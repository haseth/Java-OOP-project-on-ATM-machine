<h1>ATM Machine</h1>
 <b>A console object oriented programming project on ATM machine. </b>

<h2>Present Project:<br>
  <ul>
  <li>A Account Holder goes to machine ,provide his credentials .
  <li>Account Manager checks the credentials and returns customers account to the machine(his name ,acc number, balance).
